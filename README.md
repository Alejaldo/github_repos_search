# GitHub Repository Search Application

## Introduction

This project is a web application that allows users to search for GitHub repositories by keywords. It utilizes the GitHub API and provides detailed information about the repositories, such as name, full name, description, owner, HTML URL, and stargazers count.

## Implementation Details

### Current Features

- **Search Repositories**: Users can search for GitHub repositories using keywords.
- **Detailed Results**: The results include information like name, full name, description, owner, HTML URL, and stargazers count.

### Technology Stack

- **Ruby on Rails**
- **Database**: The application currently does not utilize a database as it fetches information directly from the GitHub API. There is no need to persist data, which simplifies the architecture and reduces the overhead.
- **Testing**: RSpec, Capybara, and WebMock are used for robust testing of features and integrations.

## How to Set Up and Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git`
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: `cd your_project_directory`
3. **Install Dependencies**: `bundle install`
4. **Set Up the Database**: `rails db:create db:migrate`
5. **Start the Server**: `rails server`
6. **Run Tests**: Use `rspec` to run all the test cases.

## Future Improvements

- **Background Processing**: Integrate Sidekiq and Redis to offload certain tasks to background workers.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improve user interface and user experience.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporate more filtering options for search results.
